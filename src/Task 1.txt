Thought Process - Break everything into smaller steps

Reading txt files - ReadFile()
    - Make a function that can read a txt file.
    - Figure out how to break down the txt file into readable strings.

 Reading txt file content - ReadFileContent()
    - How I was going to split the line string and interpret it.
    - I found using an Array to hold the values, so I can go through it worked.

 CheckStringArray()
    - I noticed while coding the above function that I will need to check if there is the correct amount of arguments.

Adding things - Add() & Item Object
    - I created the Item.java file to store an Item object.
    - The item object has a name, qty and price.

    - I created a HashMap to hold all my inventory data
    - I noticed that I would need to check if the item is already in the inventory and if so add to quantity

 Check();
    - I noticed that I would need to create a ArrayList <string> to hold all unique items in the inventory
    - So that I could loop through then to display each item and their qty.

 Sell()
    - We will need to grab the current last price that the item was sold for
    - Change the qty of the item
